For example, we host biweekly Devtalks where our senior and lead developers talk about topics they are passionate about. Previous topics have included Web3, NFT, Laravel 9, Kubernetes, etc. We hold these talks in the office but you can join our Zoom broadcast as well. Feel free to join either as an attendee or a speaker!"
